osu-iPhone
==========

A dated iPhone port by nuudles

As part of an effort to open source the full osu! stack, I (peppy) am splitting out ports which are currently stored in the monolithic git repository. This is an iPhone port made by nuudles which is (to my knowledge) still live on cydia. Keep in mind that the last changes were made in 2009 and therefore it may not work with newer maps.

No official support is provided for this. Licence pending.

As a footnote, if you are intertested in getting this working or updated, I'd ask that you contact me first. I have plans on getting osu!stream into a state it can load osu! beatmaps, as I believe this would be a better solution than working with this codebase. Should someone be skilled (and interested) enough to help with this, I will consider opening up the source for osu!stream as well.
